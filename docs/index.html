Anyone who has ever played Mario Kart knows that there is a trade-off between top speed and acceleration.
The larger characters tend to have poor acceleration but a good top speed while the smaller characters tend to have good acceleration but suffer from a low top speed.
In this lab you will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each side of this trade-off.
You may assume that the accelerations are constant accelerations.
<br><br>
Use the simulation below to set up a scenario where the race ends in a tie.
Do <i>not</i> simply give each character the exact same acceleration and top speed.
Once you have accomplished this, make plots of position vs time (so position goes on the vertical axis and time goes on the horizontal axis) and velocity vs time for each character.
<br><br>
Some additional instructions/comments:
<ul>
<li>The simulation is unlikely to work on a cell phone, so please use a proper computer.</li>
<li>You can adjust each character's top speed (vmax) and acceleration (a) with the "+" and "-" buttons.</li>
<li>Start the race by clicking the green button in the bottom left. The blue button will pause and the red button will reset.</li>
<li>The purple buttons in the bottom-center allow you to go one frame at a time either forwards (right button) or backwards (left button).</li>
<li>Time is measured in frames (see top-center of the screen) and distance is measured in pixels; no need to do any unit conversion, just use frames and pixels throughout (so velocity, for example, is measured in pixels per frame).</li>
<li>The starting line and finish line are 1000 pixels apart.</li>
<li>Use the <i>back</i> of each character as the reference point. So, the race is complete when the <i>entire</i> character has crossed the finish line, not just his nose.</li>

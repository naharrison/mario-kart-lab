Make sure to follow the hint given in the instructions, i.e. the problem needs to be broken down into parts. Try thinking about and answering some of these questions:

How much time does it take a kart to reach its maximum velocity?

How far does it travel in this amount of time?

How much distance remains once the kart reaches its maximum velocity?

What is the acceleration after the kart reaches its maximum velocity?

How much time does it take for the kart to cover this remaining distance?
